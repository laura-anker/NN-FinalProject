# Neural Networks Final Project: Image Colorization

## Summary 
We are developing a deep learning model with the aim of colorizing grayscale images. We are using a U-Net that will enable the model to capture global and local image feature through encoder-decoder design as well as a cGAN framework to encourage generation of more realistic color outputs through introducing an adversarial objective. Our dataset includes approximately 25,000 grayscale images of a variety of scenes and objects. 

We cannot include our data on GitHub due to Kaggle policies, but you can view it at the link below.
